;;; SOFTWARE STACK:
;;; 
;;; The software stack starts high in memory (configurable) and grows downward.
;;; It should be used for pushing pointer-sized (16 bits) values only.
;;; The software stack is scanned conservatively when determining the GC
;;; root set, so anything on the stack that looks like a pointer is treated
;;; as such.
;;; 
;;; HEAP:
;;;
;;; The heap stores LISP objects. It starts at a "low" address and grows
;;; upwards towards the top of the stack. Heap and stack overflows are
;;; trivially checked by comparing the two pointers. Unlike the stack, the
;;; heap is not automatically managed; as objects become unreachable, a
;;; garbage collector kicks in and cleans them up.
;;;
;;; Every object on the heap is tagged with a one-byte "type tag".
;;; Currently the following types are recognized:
;;;   - Pairs (cons cells, to form lists)
;;;   - Integers
;;;   - Symbols (interned, to allow "eq?"-type comparisons)
;;;

;;; CALLING CONVENTION:
;;;
;;; Procedure calls shall not clobber the X and Y registers. The A register is
;;; used for the return value and is thus not preserved across calls. It is
;;; always the callee's responsibility to preserve X and Y. The special
;;; PTR location on the ZP is used to return 16-bit results.
;;;
;;; Parameters are passed on the software stack in reverse order.
;;; The callee is responsible for popping arguments of the stack,
;;; meaning that SSP_before_call = SSP_after_call.
