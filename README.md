# Dependencies

* [apple2e-audio-transport](https://github.com/hausdorff/apple2e-audio-transport), a small library written specifically for this project. Sends the program over the audio jack to the Apple IIe.
* [sox](http://sox.sourceforge.net/), which we use to emit sound to the Apple IIe.
* [cpp](http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/cpp/), the C preprocessor; we write macros to make programming in the 6502 instruction set slightly easier.
* [xa](http://www.floodgap.com/retrotech/xa/)(aka xa65), assembler for the 6502 instruction set.
